## File Organizer <br>
*This project was inspired by [Kalle Halden](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWr0mx597DnSGLFk1WfvSkQ)*
<br>
<br>
Following the conclusion of this semester, I attempted to find a way to efficiently clean and sort all of the notes, pdfs, and documents I have collected over the semester.
In the attached python script, when a file (regardless of file extension) is dropped into a certain folder, it is immediately sent to an appropriate folder based on file type.
<br>
<br>
*Be aware that you will have to edit the script so that your respective file addresses can be read & accessed.* <br>
<br>
Thanks
